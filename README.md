divar website static home page with HTML and CSS

# description

this was my first project that I used HTML and CSS with each other to make a static page. before this I just practiced with them and didn't
create anytnig that was challeging. in this project I only used float for moving items around and this was a challenge of it's own. I could 
use technologies like flexbox or grid but I wanted to have a good understanding of how static pages were made in the past.other challenges that I had includes: how to make the sidebar scroll instead of the whole page and how to create the card items so that the image and text 
be exacly like the website design.
